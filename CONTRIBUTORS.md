# Contributors

This document will evolve as we make sure to include all the contributors to the
VotingWorks system.

## VotingWorks Pioneers

VotingWorks has benefited from the input of dozens of election administrators
around the country. Some of them were particularly helpful: they took a chance
on VotingWorks at the pilot stage, when all we had were prototypes. They dealt
with the pains of an in-development product and gave us critical feedback.
VotingWorks wouldn't be VotingWorks without them.
