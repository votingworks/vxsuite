# Contributors

This document will evolve as we make sure to include all the
contributors to the VotingWorks system.

## VotingWorks Pioneers

VotingWorks has benefited from the input of dozens of election
administrators around the country. Some of them were particularly
helpful: they took a chance on VotingWorks at the pilot stage, when
all we had were prototypes. They dealt with the pains of an
in-development product and gave us critical feedback. VotingWorks
wouldn't be VotingWorks without them.
