# VotingWorks Ballot Scanner

Previously known as Ballot Scanning Device (BSD) or VxScan.

## Public Demo

- <https://bsd.votingworks.app>

Each [pull request](https://github.com/votingworks/bsd/pulls) will have a unique
demo url which can be found in the comments of the pull request.

## Install

Prerequisites:

- `git`
- `pnpm`
- [`module-scan`](https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite/tree/main/apps/module-scan)
- [`module-smartcards`](https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite/tree/main/apps/module-smartcards)

Thenâ€¦

```
git clone https://github.com/votingworks/bsd.git
cd bsd
pnpm install
```

## Run

1. Start [`module-scan`](https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite/tree/main/apps/module-scan).
2. Start
   [`module-smartcards`](https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite/tree/main/apps/module-smartcards).
3. Start the app:

   ```
   pnpm start
   ```

To set the election configuration you will either need to scan a smartcard (you can use the mockCardReader script in module-smartcards for this), load an election.json file, or load a ballot export zip file. You should load a ballot export zip if you intend to test hand-marked paper ballots (HMPBs).

To display a batch of scanned ballots use the MOCK_SCANNER_FILES environment variable set as described in [`module-scan`](https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite/tree/main/apps/module-scan).
