# VxMark Backend

Backend server for the VxMark ballot marking app.

## Setup

Follow the instructions in the [VxSuite README](../../../README.md)

You generally should not need to run the backend directly. Instead, run the
frontend, which will automatically run the backend.

```sh
cd apps/mark/frontend
pnpm start
```

## Testing

```sh
pnpm test
```
