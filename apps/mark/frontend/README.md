# Legacy VxMark

An early iteration of VxMark that supports ballot marking and printing but not
casting.

What we now refer to as VxMark lives in [apps/mark-scan](../../mark-scan).

## Setup

Follow the instructions in the [VxSuite README](../../../README.md) to get set
up, then run the app like so:

```sh
# In apps/mark/frontend
pnpm start
```

The server will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Testing

```sh
pnpm test
```
