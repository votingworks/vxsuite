**Experimental Prototype**

An application for designing ballots.

## Setup

Follow the instructions in the [VxSuite README](../../README.md) to get set up,
then run the app like so:

```sh
pnpm start
```

The server will be available at http://localhost:3000/.

## Test Ballots

The [fixtures](./fixtures) directory contains sample ballots for testing.

These ballots can be regenerated after code changes using the following command:

```sh
pnpm regenerate-fixtures
```
