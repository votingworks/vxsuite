# Admin Module

## Setup

Follow the instructions in the [VxSuite README](../../../README.md) to get set
up. This service is intended to be run as part of the VxAdmin stack and is used
by the `election-manager` frontend, not run on its own. To run it as part of
VxAdmin, run this:

```sh
# in apps/admin/frontend
pnpm start
```

## Testing

```sh
pnpm test
```
