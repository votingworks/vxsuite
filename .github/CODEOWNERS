# VxSuite CodeOwners

# These owners are used to automate code reviews, if there is a specific part of the codebase you would like to be tagged on reviews for add yourself as a code owner.

# The order of this file is important. The last matching rule will take precedence.

# By default assign the vxsuite-eng group
* @votingworks/vxsuite-eng

# More specific ownership, recommended to continue to include the vxsuite-eng group in these so that that still gets added to all PRs.
