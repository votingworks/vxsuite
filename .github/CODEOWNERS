# VxSuite Code Owners

# These owners are used to automate code reviews, if there is a specific part of the codebase you would like to be tagged on reviews for add yourself as a code owner.

# The order of this file is important. The last matching rule will take precedence.

# By default assign the vxsuite-eng group. Code reviews will be randomly round-robined within this group to assign someone on the team for a general code review.

# More specific ownership rules for more knowledge-specific reviews.
# It is recommended to continue to include the vxsuite-eng group in these so knowledge doesn't get too siloed and people gain context on code outside of what they own.
