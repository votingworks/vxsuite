# Code Exercises for VxSuite

This project contains a set of exercises to help you learn how to use the
VxSuite libraries.

## Running the Exercises

To get started, set up the VxSuite repository as usual. Then, in this directory,
run `pnpm test`. This will run the tests for all of the exercises. By default in
watch mode, Jest will not run anything because no files have been changed. You
can use the Jest CLI to run the tests for a specific exercise, e.g.
`pnpm jest --watch 01-iteration/01-toArray.exercise.ts`. I recommend running
with `--watch` so that you can see the tests update as you make changes.
