# Code Exercises for VxSuite

This project contains a set of exercises to help you learn how to use the
VxSuite libraries.

## Running the Exercises

To get started, set up the VxSuite repository as usual. Then, in this directory,
run `pnpm test`. This will run the tests for all of the exercises. You can use
the Vitest CLI to run the tests for a specific exercise, e.g.
`pnpm vitest 01-iteration/01-toArray.exercise.ts`.
