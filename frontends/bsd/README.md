# VotingWorks Ballot Scanner (BSD) (VxCentralScan)

Scans ballots printed by the VxSuite [Ballot Marking Device (BMD)](../bmd) or
the VxSuite [Election Manager](../election-manager).

## Setup

Follow the instructions in the [VxSuite README](../../README.md) to get set up,
then run the app like so:

```sh
# in frontends/bsd
pnpm start
```

The server will be available at http://localhost:3000/.

To set the election configuration you will either need to scan a smartcard (you
can use the mockCardReader script in
[services/smartcards](../../services/smartcards) for this), load an
election.json file, or load a ballot export zip file from
[election-manager](../election-manager). You should load a ballot export zip if
you intend to test hand-marked paper ballots (HMPBs).

To display a batch of scanned ballots use the `MOCK_SCANNER_FILES` environment
variable set as described in [`services/scan`](../../services/scan).

## Testing

```sh
pnpm test
```
