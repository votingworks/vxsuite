 * must be a Promise.
 *
 * Method input and output values must be serializable to JSON and
 * deserializable from JSON. Grout supports built-in JSON types as well as some
 * extras (e.g. undefined, Error, Result). See the serialization module for

// - We can't enforce the constraints on method input at compile time, because
//  function argument subtyping is contravariant, meaning that for an RPC method to
//  be a subtype of AnyRpcMethod, its input must be a supertype of
//  Parameters<AnyRPCMethod>. Function return value subtyping is covariant, which
//  is why we can enforce the Promise constraint there. Maybe there's another
//  approach that would work, but I couldn't figure it out. Instead I opted to
//  just put in runtime checks during serialization/deserialization.
//
// - There are a few reasons behind having one single input argument object:
//   - Input parameters will be named in the serialized JSON, which will
//   hopefully make it more human-readable and ease debugging.
//   - If we ever need to extend Grout to inject extra metadata into the RPC
//   methods (e.g. accessing the current user via req.session), we can extend
//   the input object with special fields. It's less straightforward to do this
//   with a list of arguments.

 * (see the serialization module for details). This allows requests to be
 * human-readable while still supporting richer types than plain JSON.
 *
 * Unexpected exceptions will return a 500 status code with a plain JSON
 * response containing the error mesage. This will cause the client to throw an
 * exception.
 *
 * You should NOT throw exceptions from your RPC methods for known errors (e.g.
 * invalid input). Instead, use the Result type to return known errors.  This
 * ensures that consumers of the method will be forced to handle that error case
 * explicitly.
