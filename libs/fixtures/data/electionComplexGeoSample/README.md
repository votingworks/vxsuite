### Fixture Purpose

Model a slightly more complex geography for ballot styles / precincts than our
other fixtures do. In particular, the fixture contains examples of:

- a single precinct containing multiple ballot styles
- a single ballot style across multiple precincts
- non-hierarchical districts that intersect to form cross sections
