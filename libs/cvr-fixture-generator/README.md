# Cast Vote Record Fixture Generator

A command-line tool for generating cast vote record fixtures from ballot
packages. Generates BMD ballot CVRs for VotingWorks election definitions and
HMPB ballot CVRs for NH (`gridLayouts`) election definitions

## Usage

```bash
# from libs/cvr-fixture-generator
./bin/generate --electionDefinition ./election.json --outputPath ./standard-cvr-fixture
```

Optional flags:

- `--officialBallots` - whether to export a report for official ballots. By
  default the report is for test ballots.
- `--scannerIds` - if provided with a space-separated list of scanner ids, there
  will be cast vote records for each of the listed scanners. Otherwise, all
  records will appear to come from a single `scanner`.
- `--numBallots` - number of records to include in the fixture. If no number is
  required, the default number is determined as the number of possible variants
  of ballot style, precinct, ballot type (absentee or precinct), scanner, and
  vote variations.
- `--ballotIdPrefix` - a prefix to prepend to every ballot id (or `UniqueId` in
  the CDF). Since ballot ids are incrementing numbers starting from 1, they will
  have id collisions in VxAdmin if they are not distinguished by a prefix.

## Vote Variations

The export may include the following vote variations for candidate contests:

- any possible vote variations with the correct number of votes
- a variant for each possible number of undervotes
- a variant for each possible number of overvotes
- if write-ins are allowed for the contest, any possible vote variations with
  the correct number of votes which includes one write-in

For ballot measure contests, each of the four possible vote variations are
included.

## Limitations

- Multi-sheet ballots are not supported. There is no underlying technical
  limitation, we just do not have the fixtures or the requirement yet to test
  this and ensure the fixtures are correct.
- Vote variations do not include any cases of multiple write-ins for a single
  contest
- Vote variations do not reflect any probable real-world distribution of votes.
  For example, the number of undervotes and overvotes for ballot measure
  contests is extremely high.
- Ballot images do not have any real marks on them, they are only blank pages.
