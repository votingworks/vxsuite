NodeJS bindings for
[LSD: a Line Segment Detector](http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2012/gjmr-lsd/)
[v1.6](http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2012/gjmr-lsd/lsd_1.6.zip). From the original
article:

> LSD is a linear-time Line Segment Detector giving subpixel accurate results.
> It is designed to work on any digital image without parameter tuning. It
> controls its own number of false detections: On average, one false alarms is
> allowed per image. The method is based on Burns, Hanson, and Riseman's method,
> and uses an a-contrario validation approach according to Desolneux, Moisan,
> and Morel's theory. The version described here includes some further
> improvement over the one described in the original article.

## Setup

This package is private and is not intended to be published to NPM, but is for
use within the `vxsuite` monorepo. To use it from a library or app within the
monorepo, run `pnpm i -S '@votingworks/lsd@workspace:*'` in the library/app
root.

Follow the instructions in the [VxSuite README](../../README.md) to get set up,
then get started like so:

```sh
# test on changes
pnpm test:watch
```

# API Usage

```ts
import lsd from '@votingworks/lsd';

// get a 1-channel grayscale `ImageData` object somehow
const gray = await readGrayscaleImage(path);

// get line segments
const segments = lsd(gray);

console.log(segments);
// [{ x1: 63.59566, x2: 63.59566, y1: 0.625, y2: 126.875, width: 1.25 }, ‚Ä¶]
```

# CLI Usage

This package includes a CLI for quick testing of images:

```sh
$ pnpx lsd path/to/image.png
üìù path/to/image-lsd.svg
```

Open the SVG file in an SVG viewer (e.g. Chrome) to view it. See
`pnpx lsd --help` for more options.
