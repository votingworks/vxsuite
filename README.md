# VxSuite

The core of the VotingWorks paper-ballot voting system.

## About

Includes software for:

- [VxAdmin](./apps/admin/frontend) — An offline central election manager laptop
- [VxCentralScan](./apps/central-scan/frontend) — A central scanner for batch
  scanning of ballots, often used for absentee ballot processing
- [VxMark](./apps/mark-scan/frontend) — A fully accessible ballot-marking device
  (BMD)
- [VxScan](./apps/scan/frontend) — A precinct scanner for casting of ballots
  (marked by hand or by BMD)
- [VxDesign](./apps/design/frontend) — An application for designing ballots
- [VxPollBook](./apps/pollbook/frontend) — A pollbook application for checking
  in voters

VxAdmin and VxCentralScan comprise the "central system." VxMark and VxScan
comprise the "precinct system."

VxDesign exists separate from the other apps and is managed by VotingWorks
rather than deployed on hardware into locales.
